# maze
programs for maze generation (and perhaps solving)

use: python maze.py [\<height\> [\<width\> [\<seconds to generate whole thing\>]]]

use: python hexMaze.py [\<height\> [\<width\>]]

use: python triMaze.py [\<height\> [\<width\>]]




The directories contain example mazes of varying sizes (kerned and sized to look pretty)



TODO: 
•find a way to render a penrose tiling with ascii art and have it look believable
•make a maze generator that works on a graph datatype
