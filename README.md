# maze
programs for maze generation (and perhaps solving)

use: python maze.py [<height> [<width> [<seconds to generate whole thing>]]]

use: python hexMaze.py [<height> [<width>]]

use: python triMaze.py [<height> [<width>]]




The directories contain example mazes of varying sizes (kerned and sized to look pretty)
